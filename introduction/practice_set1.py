in bondage caused great fear
The Confederacy didn’t care for Lincoln 
The Civil War had been going on for over an entire year
Lincoln then made a power move to get them to conform 
He signed the Emancipation Proclamation it didn’t work though 
the Confederacy pushed back with great determination
After two years of battle full of frustration and ultimate humiliation 
In April of 1865 Robert E. Lee surrendered ending the Civil War
But see Black people were not truly free until 
Freedom had blessed each and every door
One instance was marching into Galveston Texas on June 19th 
The News was spread strong and loud
The Abolitionist had succeeded a true moment to be proud 
The 13th Amendment it plugged up 
Some of those holes that the Emancipation missed
Please I encouraged you to put both of them on your must-read list
The rejoice began the rebuilding surging through our Black veins 
Building our community securing our Black reigns
We are qualified builders and planters sowing the seed of upliftment
Something out of nothing we build our own equipment
Depending on where you lived is when you celebrated being free
We didn’t have cell phones or the internet 
News took some time to reach every city 
April of ’62 began the festivities in DC
Tennessee gotta glimpse at the end in August of ’63
Ohio grasped a hold to freedom in 1862 in September
While Kentucky didn’t see freedom until 1865 in December
Many Variations of a well-deserved celebration called by many names 
Freedom Day Jubilee Day Emancipation Day 2nd Independence Day
Throughout the United States freedom was celebrated
Striving for upliftment not to be underestimated
America was taking a turn and now suffered a great depression
Designed laws which supported systemic oppression
Fueled by greed corruption racism and domination
None of that was stopped by the Emancipation
Housing and education and the onset of strong Jim Crow
Laws were being passed to protect the status quo
Civil Rights movement Kwanzaa Boycotts 
And the Rebellion caused the celebrations to be reignited
Celebrating Black people abolishing racist laws got me excited
Experiencing horrible tragedies we still try to instill hope
Through education and upliftment we will have growth
You changed the world George
Juneteenth is a National Holiday
An accumulation and great anticipation as we 
Come together to strive forward 
As a unified Black nation
Going forward what does that mean
One more day to sleep in and take a long bath
One more day that you can get time and a half
One more day from work or school
One more BBQ to go to
I challenge you to look into the eyes 
Of our beautiful Black children 
And make them a promise
You will strive for them to learn all that they can be a leader in the crowd
You will support perseverance to keep pushing and to be proud
You will do your very best for them so they can succeed
You will encourage them to thrive and plant the seed
